It is a distant cousin inspired by the template written by Karl Voit [https://github.com/novoid/LaTeX-KOMA-template].
The only part that was directly used is the text from the affidavit and its custom command textfield.

Further, some settings were adapted from the r-markdown pandoc conversion template to make this template r-markdown compatible.

In short, you're more than welcome to use, adapt or share this template, as long as you do not remove the authorship and keep the CC SA licence.
The resulting PDF has absolutely no restrictions.
